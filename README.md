# About Me:
**Shivani Sadam**
Hello, my name is Shivani Sadam and I am from Irvine, California and currently a senior at Indiana University. I am majoring in management information systems at the Kelley School of Business and minoring in human centered computing at the Luddy School of Computing. I want to work in the technology and business industry (based on my major) to get into tech consulting and be able to work with many clients to learn more about this vast industry. I have interned at Deloitte last summer and planning to work there after I graduate from IU this year in May. Being from California, I love going to the beach and getting food with friends during my free time. I am looking to expand my career in tech consulting by networking with coworkers at Deloitte to learn more about the company culture and finding ways to succeed individually.
